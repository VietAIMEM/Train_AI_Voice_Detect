With the rapid advancement of AI-based voice synthesis and voice cloning technologies, distinguishing between human speech and AI-generated speech has become increasingly challenging. 
This project addresses the problem of detecting fake voices generated by artificial intelligence, with a focus on real-world applicability.

The dataset used in this project is collected from multiple sources and consists entirely of Vietnamese speech audio. 
For reproducibility and further experimentation, the dataset is publicly available via Hugging Face.

To tackle this problem, we employ state-of-the-art deep learning models, specifically Conformer and AASIST, for speech anti-spoofing and binary speech classification (human vs. AI-generated voice).
